# Scriptable

This repository contains all of my better-maintained Scriptable scripts. A full description of scripts follows.

### [`PluralKit.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SapphicCode/Scriptable/mistress/PluralKit.js)

This script presents a widget to interface with [PluralKit](https://pluralkit.me)'s API. It presents the current system front (or system name and avatar), to keep track of a given system.
